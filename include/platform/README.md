# What is this?
These are the platform-specific configurations, which specify e.g. which sensors are available and on what pin is which device / sensor / whatever. These files are also used to specify e.g. workarounds on problematic hardware-releases. These headers are intended to only reflect hardware-specific rules, which should not be overridden by the normal user using the `platformio.ini` files, as they commonly also require modification of the hardware itself or describe board-specific stuff.

If you wish to extend the `define`-s in those files, please make sure to port your changes to all the other files (platforms) as well.

If you want to port the OSW-OS to another platform, these files are probably the first thing you want to look at. :)

## Your modified platforms...
You decided to modify your hardware and therefore modified some files here? In that case, make your live easier by creating a new file in this folder, called `.gitignore`:

```
.gitignore
*.h
```

...this way your changes won't be shown while committing, especially as I love to use `git commit .` to commit all my changes in the project at once...
